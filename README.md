## About

This project is part of my [100 days of code challenge](https://github.com/ciurca/100-days-of-code).
I started playing around with JavaScript and decided that it would be good practice to start building an actual website.

## What it is

This is a website that displays the COVID-19 cases by county (Romania).

I am using JavaScript to pull in the information from a JSON file provided by [Graphs.ro](https://www.graphs.ro/resources.php). The information is displayed using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) (used [this](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) tutorial to create the map), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for the chart generator and [Latinize.js](https://github.com/dundalek/latinize) for the search function.

Please support the projects above if you can, because this site wouldn't have been possible without them.

## Important note

This website was created just as a means for me to better understand JavaScript and also practice it. It shouldn't be used as an actual means of getting COVID-19 Romania data, as there much better ways of getting the data (see [Graphs.ro](https://www.graphs.ro/)). 

If you are affiliated in any way with any organization that thinks that this website is violating something and it should be taken down, please contact me personally on Twitter [@raduciurca](https://twitter.com/raduciurca).
